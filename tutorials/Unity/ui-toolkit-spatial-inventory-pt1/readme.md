# Introduction

Inventory systems are a great way to help facilitate how you want the player to engage in your game. Perhaps one of the most important components to consider are the constraints you want the system to help enforce. For example, many games gate what a player can carry based on the total weight of all the items. A slightly less common way is based on the item size. This has been done by games such as Resident Evil 4 and Dues Ex. In addition to controlling how much a player can carry, it also creates a mini game out of the inventory by requiring them to strategically organize to maximize what they can carry.

This tutorial is part of a series which will explore how you can create an inventory that requires the player to sort by item size. Part 1 will walk through creating the UI design below.
